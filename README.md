# Swisstronik Developer Challenge 2

## Contract Addresses Of Challange Contract
Swisstronik : 0xa6cb0aE419915F1374f132B834a1E00ba94e412f <br>
Mumbai : 0x1d7C29a84F3472A8335ef5715770E9bDAB584ff6

## How It Works? 
By default challange contract creates a variable named number and assigns it to 7 when it is deployed for the first time to blockchain. The value of this variable can be read by calling getNumber() or modified by calling setNumber(uint256).
However, users can also access to the value of the variable in  Mumbai and Swisstronik testnets by calling the RPC method eth.getStorageAt() as an alternative to getNumber() and the scripts GetStorageOnMumbai.js and GetStorageOnSwisstronik.js do it for users.
In order to call them run following commands on terminal:<br> 
npx hardhat run  scripts/GetStorageOnMumbai.js<br> 
npx hardhat run  scripts/GetStorageOnSwisstronik.js
